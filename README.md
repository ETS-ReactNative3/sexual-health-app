# Sexual Health Application - Final Year Project

This JS application developed on ReactNative proposes a UX for finding and booking appointments for Sexual Health Clinics in London.

This project employs cross-platform technologies such as ReactNative to develop a mobile application for iOS which features a user-friendly UI. Employing a UCD approach and an exhaustive competitive analysis, the UX is designed utilising the latest medical interface trends and Material Design standards.

As a client-server architecture, the application connects through an API (AppSync) to a highly scalable and secure cloud server (AWS) to store and retrieve data. The design of the Amazon database obeys to the NHS data standards by separating sensible data in different containers. The client-side features also a robust and scalable folder structure and professional coding patterns such as Redux for managing status.
