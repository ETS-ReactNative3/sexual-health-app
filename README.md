# Sexual Health Application - Final Year Project

This JS application developed on ReactNative proposes a UX for finding and booking appointments for Sexual Health Clinics in London.

This project employs cross-platform technologies such as ReactNative to develop a mobile application for iOS which features a user-friendly UI. Employing a UCD approach and an exhaustive competitive analysis, the UX is designed utilising the latest medical interface trends and Material Design standards.

As a client-server architecture, the application connects through an API (AppSync) to a highly scalable and secure cloud server (AWS) to store and retrieve data. The design of the Amazon database obeys to the NHS data standards by separating sensible data in different containers. The client-side features also a robust and scalable folder structure and professional coding patterns such as Redux for managing status.

## Learning outcomes 

* LO1. Clearly define a problem which demonstrates a real need, and set aims and objectives which, if met, will result in: (i) an appropriate solution to the problem and (ii) an evaluation of the extent to which the solution addresses the problem.
* LO2. Undertake relevant background investigation using appropriate sources, analysing and evaluating the information found in order to: (i) clearly define the problem being addressed and (ii) identify ways in which a solution may be developed and evaluated.
* LO3. Apply practical and analytical skills to develop an information system solution which addresses the problem set out in the aims and objectives. This should include the use of relevant methods, tools and techniques. For Computer Science students, this must include the implementation of a non-trivial software solution. For Business Computing students, this must include a detailed focus on design .
* LO4. Identify and use appropriate methods to evaluate the proposed solution and draw conclusions as to its effectiveness.
* LO5. Use project and self-management skills to plan and monitor the project process, and to undertake a critical self-evaluation which identifies how the project could have been better undertaken.
* LO6. Effectively communicate relevant project ideas, approaches, solutions, and evaluation.
* LO7. Demonstrate engagement with the University’s ethics process and, where required, gain formal ethical
approval from the University and evidence this in the project report.

## Aims and objectives

This mobile application aims to connect users with the nearest Sexual Health Clinic in London and allow them to book an appointment. On the server side a scalable, secure and robust cloud database stores the appointments data in real time. Built on professional software architecture, the system will feature an outstanding user experience which makes it highly marketable. To satisfy the this aim, the project should accomplish the following objectives.

### Background Research
Employing Brunel library resources, Google Scholar, Academia.edu and data from government bodies such as the Department of Health (DoH), Public Health England and NHS data to understand the importance of sexual health, as seen in chapter 2: Sexual Health and Online services in London.

### Approach
Pursuing a dynamic, simple and professional approach to research, design, implementation, evaluation and reflection that ensures structure and precise results. These methodologies are found in the second section of every chapter (2.2,3.2,4.2,5.2) except for this chapter which is in section 1.3 Project approach overview.

### Design
Utilising UCD to craft an outstanding UX following Material Design and medical applications guidelines. Finding the most suitable visuals techniques to build robust mock-ups such as Adobe XD and clearly illustrating the purpose of APIs, AWS server components and Dynamo tables using diagrams. 

### Implementation and Testing
Developing and test a robust and highly marketable application employing React Native and JavaScript that runs on iOS devices. Applying, Amazon AppSync API, the Redux coding pattern and professional mobile development practices. Explained in chapter 4: Implementation and testing.

### Evaluation
Evaluate the application using a focus group and questionnaire based on the Health IT Usability Model. Subsequently, analyse the survey data applying the mode and median and plot the result on to a graph for interpretation. Described in chapter 5: Evaluation.
